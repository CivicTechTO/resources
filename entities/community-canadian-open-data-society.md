  We are a national collective of open data supporters who strive to promote and support relevant initiatives across the country. This can range from working directly on creating content for digital literacy to driving events like our webinars.
  We are also the organization that works with partners to hold our Canadian Open Data Summits, where hundreds of open data and open government stakeholders meet to learn and collaborate on various initiatives.
